# My App

This app was created in [Init](init.page), a tool for creating the foundation of cross-platform apps with [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).

## Important

Init is an early product and there may be bugs with the export. However, the goal is to accelerate the start of a new app, so be prepared to use the exported code but adapt it for your use case.

## Usage

This zip file contains the generated source code of each page and any relevant files such as routing configurations. It does *not* include a full app out of the box, just the parts that are relevant to the app created in Init.

To use, create a new Ionic app following the instructions for your framework of choice, then copy over the relevant code for each page you'd like to have in your app, making sure to properly configure the routing files necessary to link all the pages together.
